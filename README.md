# Simplot
* This tools is used for visualization of real time data. The tool accepts data over serial port and plots it in real time on the screen. 

* Plots data from serial port

* 4 Channels of data

* 16bit signed data type (Arduino int datatype)

* X & Y axis range user selectabl

# iArduino: a C Interpreter for Arduino
* The iArduino is an interpreter which runs on Arduino board. Interpreted language is a programming language in which programs are 'indirectly' executed ("interpreted") by an interpreter program (see Wikipedia.)

* The iArduino interprets a language which resembles to the Arduino language. It can

* evaluate an expression refelctively,
* do stepwise executtion of a program,
* run a program slowly,
* stop and resume a program.
